# auto clicker
The program will start clicking the mouse continuously until you stop it by pressing `CTRL+C` or closing the window.

## Customization

To customize the behavior of the autoclicker, you can edit the `autoclick` function in the `autoclicker.py` file. For example, you can specify the number of times to click, the interval between clicks, or the location of the mouse cursor. You can also use the `time` module to add delays or pause the program.

## Warning

Using an autoclicker can be considered cheating in some situations, so use it with caution.
